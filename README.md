# Python-Django-REST-API

Building a REST API with Python Django from Scratch
So I've been teaching myself about APIs, and honestly, after watching what felt like a million tutorials, I was getting a bit tired of just following along without actually building anything real. You know how it is - you can watch tutorials all day, but until you actually get your hands dirty with a project, it doesn't really stick.
That's when I stumbled across this awesome YouTube tutorial by Pedro Tech (https://youtu.be/NoLF7Dlu5mc). Instead of just another explanation of how APIs work, this guy actually walks you through building a complete REST API from scratch using Python and Django. Finally, something I could actually follow along with and build!
Following Pedro's tutorial, I managed to create my first proper API, and it actually works! It was such a cool feeling to see everything come together - all those concepts I'd been learning about finally made sense when I could see them working in a real project.
The best part was that instead of just understanding the theory, I got to experience what it's actually like to build an API. There's definitely something to be said for learning by doing - it's way more effective than just watching endless tutorials. Now I actually feel like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to REST APIs and Django!
